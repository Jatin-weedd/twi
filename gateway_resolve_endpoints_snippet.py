gateway_resolve_endpoints_snippet.py
─────────────────────────────────────
Merge these two routes into your existing gateway app (the one deployed on
Render, connected to your GitHub repo). This assumes FastAPI, matching the
X-API-Key convention your /api/v1/manifest and /tiles/{filename} routes
already use — adapt names (check_api_key, your manifest data source, etc.)
to fit your actual file structure.

WHY THIS EXISTS
Your /tiles/{filename} route re-implements HTTP byte-range serving itself,
and something about that implementation isn't fully compatible with GDAL's
/vsicurl/ driver (it fails with "not recognized as being in a supported
file format" when rasterio tries to open it). Rather than debug a hand-rolled
range server blind, these routes do the one thing that's actually required —
resolve a short-lived signed URL from Hugging Face using YOUR server-side
HF_TOKEN — and hand that URL back as JSON. The client then reads that signed
URL directly via /vsicurl/, which is the exact mechanism already proven to
work reliably (it's what direct-to-HF access in Colab was already doing).

Net effect: HF_TOKEN never leaves this server. The client only ever holds
CLIENT_API_KEY. Actual data bytes stream straight from HF's CDN (fast,
proven range-request support) — this server only ever handles small JSON
resolve calls, never the heavy raster/vector traffic.

SECURITY — IMPORTANT
Do NOT accept an arbitrary repo_id/filename from the client. Only resolve
files on a fixed allowlist. Otherwise CLIENT_API_KEY becomes a master key
to anything HF_TOKEN can read, not just this product's data.
